# eT3-assessment-BigData

## Problem 1: Image Data Processing Script

This script is designed to copy images from a source folder to a destination folder while collecting details such as image size and modification date. The collected information is then presented in a DataFrame and optionally returned for further processing.

## Usage

1. Install Dependencies:
   Make sure you have the required libraries installed.

2. Run the Script:
To run the script, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 eT3_problem1.py source_folder_path destination_folder_path

Replace `source_folder_path` with the path to the source folder containing images, and `destination_folder_path` with the path to the destination folder where images will be copied.

3. Output:
The script will copy images from the source folder to the destination folder, while collecting details such as image size and modification date. The collected information is presented in a DataFrame and printed to the terminal.

Optionally, the script also returns the DataFrame, which can be further processed or used in your code.
